          <li>
            Roll the dice for the highest number, or any other fair method. Each
            player takes turns rolling the two dice to accumulate points.
          </li>
          <li>Add the numbers rolled on the dice to your current score</li>
          <li>
            If you roll a 1 on either die or both dice, you lose all the points
            you've accumulated during that turn, and your turn ends. Your score
            remains the same as it was before the turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not roll a 1 on either die, you can choose to roll again
            (go to step a) or end your turn and keep your accumulated points.
          </li>
          <li>
            To end your turn and secure your points, you can choose to "Hold."
            The "Hold" button is a virtual button or agreement between players.
            When you decide to "Hold," your current turn ends, and your total
            points for that turn are added to your overall score.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game continues until one player reaches or surpasses 100 points
            at the end of their turn. That player is declared the winner, and
            the game ends immediately.
